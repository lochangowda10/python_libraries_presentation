- VS Code or any Python IDE (optional)

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib beautifulsoup4 requests
```

**Or install individually:**
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```python
import numpy
import pandas
import matplotlib
print("All libraries installed successfully!")
```

### Step 3: Run Demo Files

Navigate to the `demos/` folder and run:

```bash
python 01_numpy_demo.py
python 02_pandas_demo.py
python 03_matplotlib_demo.py
python 04_beautifulsoup_demo.py
python 05_combined_example.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"
**Solution:** The library is not installed. Install it:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Problem: "pip is not recognized"
**Solution:** pip is not in your PATH. Use:
```bash
python -m pip install numpy
```

### Problem: Charts not displaying
**Solution:** 
- Matplotlib is not installed: `pip install matplotlib`
- Charts are still saved as PNG files in your folder
- Check if PNG files were generated

### Problem: BeautifulSoup not working
**Solution:** Install both required libraries:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

### Problem: CSV file not created
**Solution:** 
- Check if you have write permissions in the folder
- Make sure Pandas is installed: `pip install pandas`
